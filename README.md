# Code With Mosh - Java Course

>Master the Coding Skills to Become an Engineer Companies LOVE to Hire.

## What is it?

**code with mosh - java course** is the repo where I store the exercises of the course, with this name create by **Mosh Hamedani**.

This is a course divided in three parts. I strongly recommend it to speed up your Java-*hands-on*- knowledge. Instead of focusing strongly on theory, it gives enough theory basis to explain the concepts one should learn to be "job-fit" as a Java developer.
